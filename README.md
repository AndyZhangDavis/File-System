# File System

A simple file system which:
- Implements an entire FAT-based filesystem software stack: from mounting and unmounting a formatted partition, to reading and writing files, and including creating and removing files.
- Demonstrates how a formatted partition can be emulated in software and using a simple binary file, without low-level access to an actual storage device.
